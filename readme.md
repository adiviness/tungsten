Tungsten
=======

Tungsten is a statically typed, interpreted language that borrows its syntax heavily from Python, Ruby, and Go. Tungsten doesn't try to break any new ground as far as awesome language features are concerned. Tungsten exists to be a learning experience and not much more.

The language and interpreter are in a state of flux currently, what might work right now might very well be incorrect in ten minutes.
